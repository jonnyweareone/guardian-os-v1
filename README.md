## 🌟 Why We Built Guardian OS

The internet wasn't designed with children in mind. Parents are stuck choosing between over-restricting their kids or letting them wander into unsafe spaces.  

Guardian OS changes that.  

We built it to give kids **a safe, fun, and empowering digital world**, while parents stay in control without having to hover.

Guardian OS combines the stability of **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** with powerful **family protection features**.  

It creates a safe digital environment where children can learn, play, and grow — while parents can relax knowing that risks are managed in the background.
