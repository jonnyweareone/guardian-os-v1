License Terms
-------------
1. Personal / Educational Use
   You may download, install, and use Guardian OS free of charge for personal, educational, or research purposes. You may make a reasonable number of backup copies for your own use. Redistribution to third parties is not permitted without written permission.

2. Commercial Use
   Any commercial use—including, without limitation, preinstallation on devices, resale, bundling with hardware, managed services, hosting, distribution to customers/end users, or use within a for-profit organization—requires a separate commercial license from We Are One 1 Limited. Contact licensing@weareone1.com for terms.

3. Trademarks
   "Guardian", the Guardian shield logo, and associated branding are trademarks of We Are One 1 Limited. You may not use the names, logos, or trade dress to endorse or promote products or services, or to name derivative distributions, without prior written authorization. See TRADEMARKS.md.

4. Open Source Components
   Guardian OS includes open-source software (e.g., Ubuntu, GNOME) under their respective licenses (e.g., GPL). Those components remain governed by their original licenses and obligations. This license does not alter any rights granted by those licenses. Where this license conflicts with an open-source component's license with respect to that component, the open-source license controls.

5. No Warranty
   Guardian OS is provided "AS IS," without warranty of any kind, express or implied. To the maximum extent permitted by law, We Are One 1 Limited shall not be liable for any damages arising from the use of Guardian OS.
